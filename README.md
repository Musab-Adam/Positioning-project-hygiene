## My Project

### Project Built

- A sticky header that stays at the top of the page on scroll.
- A modal window that is perfectly centered of the page
- A hero section with text and buttons positioned over a background image.

### What I learned

I learned positioning and hygiene to improve my frontend development skills, where i learned how to use prettier for clean and proffesional code format and eslint for quick error handling.

I learned three projects(3) and i can now confidently built them.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

### Continued development

my next focus is on Flexbox.
